# The Tunnel Manager

The tunnel manager is where you can mark your tunnels. For fully legal maps, you'll need to be able to demonstrate the total tunnel length and mark the board edges. These can both be done with the tunnel manager. First, build the rough base layer of your tunnel. The bale placement does not need to be perfect, but you should have bales at each of the tunnel portals. Then, click "🚇 Tunnels" under the Managers subheading. 

The sidebar will change to offer options for marking your tunnels. The first tool, "🧱 Set Edges", allows you to set the board edges. You can either use the bale handles (white circles with blue outlines) or select the "Free Draw" radio button to draw your board lines anywhere you please. 

When you've got your board lines set, you can switch to drawing the path of the tunnel. Hit the "✏️Draw Path" button to enter path mode. Every board edge gets a blue diamond to represent a start and end point. Your first tunnel path must go from one diamond to another to complete. After that, you can complete a tunnel path by either clicking on another blue diamond, or clicking on an existing tunnel path (to intersect it). These intersecting lines will be automatically grouped together as one tunnel in the statistics. 

The "Show Min Width" checkbox sets out some light orange guard lines for you to position your bales along. These lines will persist even after you exit the Tunnel Manager, but you can turn them off by re-entering the manager and unchecking the box.
