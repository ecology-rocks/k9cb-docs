# Hides and Blinds

Managing hides across multiple blinds is complex. If you used to create maps in other programs, you probably had to create a bunch of copies of your course map, mark them up, and print them. Or perhaps even worse, print a bunch of copies, and mark them by hand. 

The Hides/Blinds manager is meant to make the workflow as simple as possible. When your course is set, hit the "🏆 Blinds / Hides" button under the subheading "Managers" to enter this special mode. If it's your first time in the blinds manager, it will prompt you to enter the number of blinds, and whether or not you need random numbers generated. 

In the manager, you won't be able to edit your course map, but you will be able to mark hides anywhere on your map. The sidebar will show a list of your new labeled blinds, and below, it will have buttons for hiding rats, litters, and empties. Select an already existing hide to modify its attached number, whether it's under an object, or to delete the hide. You can add blinds using the "+ Add Blind" button, or remove them with the "x" icons in the top right of their name badges.
