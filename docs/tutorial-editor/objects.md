# Objects & Their Features

A key part of the map making process is placing objects on the editor. Our objects are organized by category of usage, including:
- Walls & Zones
- Objects
- Tunnels

There are additional special categories on the sidebar, including [Bale Modifiers](bale-modifiers.md) and Binds & Hides.

## Walls & Zones

### Custom Ring Tool
You have two ways to create a ring. If your ring is a square or rectangle, you can just use the default course settings box to set those four sides of the editor to fence (regular thickness line) or wall (thick line). 

If you have an unusually shaped ring, use the Ring Shape tool. Select it from the sidebar and then click each corner of your expected ring shape to place points. When you're done, click on the first point to complete the loop. 

::: tip
If you're using a custom ring, set your grid size 2 feet wider than the ring on each dimension. This will allow the tool to showcase your ring without viewers getting confused by the grid edges. Don't set your grid edges to wall/fence if you're using a custom ring either.

### Placing Gates
Our gates are designed to stick to either the grid edge (if your ring is a square/rectangle) or to the edges of an already placed custom ring. To place a gate, select the Gate tool and click **close to** the line you want to place it on. If you click directly on the line, your computer may select the line instead of placing the gate. If you've misplaced the gate, you can click it to select it, then drag it to the closest correct location.

### Zones
We offer two colored zone types that function identically in the app. "Dead Zones" are red, and meant to be placed inside the ring in lower level courses to block off unused space. "Obstructions" are grey and meant to indicate that there is some sort of obstruction, like a pole, inside the course. You can customize these by right clicking on them and selecting "Customize" - this will allow you to set the label text and adjust the color. To adjust the size of a zone, click on it once and then drag the corner handles to their new locations.

## Basic Objects

### Bales
Bales will be your most frequently used object. To place a bale, select the bale tool and click to place. Bales are always placed long-edge horizontal. To see more about bales, check out [Bale Modifiers](bale-modifiers.md).

Default bale sizes are set in the Course Settings Modal, found by clicking the Cog icon in the top right of the sidebar. Unlike other objects, bales are not resizeable from the transform handles, but can be customized individually from the customization menu. If you need to have multiple sizes of bales, you can right click a bale to customize it. If you're placing a lot of those custom bales, we recommend a copy/paste workflow to speed things up. 

### Steps
Steps are normal transformable objects. After selecting the Step tool, click to place it. You can click it again to select it and use the handles to change its shape. To modify other properties, right click and use the Customize Styles menu. You can adjust its dimensions, text, fill color, border color, and text color as needed.

### Start Box
The Start Box is unique in that its size cannot be adjusted. You can adjust its fill color, border color, border style, and text color in the customize styles modal, accessed by right clicking on the object.

### Distance Challenge Mats
DC Mats are normal transformable objects. After selecting the DC Mat tool, click to place it. You can click it again to select it and use the handles to change its shape. To modify other properties, right click and use the Customize Styles menu. You can adjust its dimensions, text, fill color, border color, and text color as needed.

## Tunnels
The program does not recognize groupings of bales that constitute a tunnel. Instead, you will need to make the tunnel adjustments yourself. This involves:
1. Make sure that the tunnel is at least 18 inches wide.
2. Make sure that board edges (Board Lines) are placed for legal maps. Some judges prefer to place the whole board, which can be accessed with the Board Box tool. 
3. Add or check measurements as needed. 

### Board Lines
Board lines are a unique object in this editor. To place a board line, select the Board Line tool, then click and drag from where you want the line to start, releasing at where you want it to finish. If you don't like the placement, click the line once to select it, then drag the handles to their new positions. Each tunnel should have two board lines. 

### Board Boxes
Boards are normal transformable objects. After selecting the Board Boxes tool, click to place it. You can click it again to select it and use the handles to change its shape. To modify other properties, right click and use the Customize Styles menu. You can adjust its dimensions, fill color, border color, and text color as needed.
