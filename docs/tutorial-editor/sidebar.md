# Sidebar
The sidebar controls your map settings, layers, and tools.

### 1. Top Bar (Map Controls)
* **Home (🏠):** Returns to the Dashboard. *Unsaved changes will be lost unless you save first.*
* **Map Name:** Click the text box to rename your map (Pro feature).
* **Save (💾):** Saves your progress to the cloud.
* **Settings (⚙️):** Opens the Course Settings modal to adjust ring dimensions (e.g., 24x24 vs 20x20).

### 2. Layer Management
Barn Hunt maps are built in layers to handle stacking.
* **L1 / L2 / L3:** Click these pills to switch the *active* layer you are editing.
* **Overlay All Layers:** Check this box to see all layers simultaneously. You can adjust the **Layer Opacity** slider to fade out the inactive layers, making it easier to distinguish between bales on the floor (L1) and bales on top (L2).

### 3. Map Actions
The map actions change based on your active layer. For example, you can only place a **Start Box** on Layer 1.

#### Walls & Zones
* **Ring Shape:** Draw the boundary of your ring.
* **Gate:** Place the entry/exit gate.
* **Dead Zone:** Mark areas where dogs cannot go.
* **Obstruction:** Mark pillars or poles in the ring.

#### Objects
* **Bale:** Places a standard straw bale.
* **Step:** Places a climbable step.
* **Start Box (L1):** Places the 4x4 start box.
* **DC Mat (L1):** Places a specialized mat.

#### Bale Modifiers
Once a bale is placed, use these tools to modify it:
* **Orient:** Rotates the bale's orientation (Flat, Tall, Pillar).
* **Lean:** Adds a lean to the bale (Left or Right). *Note: Only FLAT bales can be leaned.*
* **Mark Bale (Anchor):** Toggles a bale as a "Fixed Anchor" for measurement references.
* **Mark Lines:** Draws anchor lines from the bale to the walls.

#### Tunnels & Boards
* **Board Line:** Draw a specific board line, which is what is required for legal maps.
* **Board Box:** Create a tunnel enclosure using full board boxes instead. Some judges prefer this.

#### Tools & Utilities
* **Select (V):** The default tool. Click to select objects or drag to select an area.
* **Rotate (R):** Rotates the selected object by 15 degrees.
* **Measure (M):** Click two points to measure the distance between them.
* **Note (N):** Place a text note on the map.

### 4. Bottom Actions

    * **Load:** Open a different map without leaving the editor.
    * **Share:** Generate a link to share with trial secretaries (Pro feature).
    * **Lib:** Access the saved library of common course elements.
