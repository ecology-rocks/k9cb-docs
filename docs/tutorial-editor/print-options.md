# Print Options

When you click on any print button in the application, the same print features will pop up. The print manager is separated by tabs on the top of the modal. 

K9 Course Builder generates a printable web file for you. If you want to save it as a PDF, you can use the "Print to PDF" feature of your computer. Otherwise, just print it using your normal print settings. Please note, the program pauses as long as a print dialog is open. So close the print dialog if you need to make some edits.

## General Tab
These options apply to all prints. Here, you can select Orientation, Layout, and Copies Per Item. 

### Orientation
Select a landscape or portrait layout for your prints.

### Layout
Select a full-page, half-page, or quarter-page layout. The legend is compacted in the smaller prints. 

### Copies Per Item
If you're printing half- or quarter- page layouts, you often want multiple copies of the same layer. E.g., if you want to print a double-sided set of course-builder maps, you would set the number of copies to 2 for a half- page and 4 for a quarter-page layout. On a half-page layout, this would result in two layer 1 images printed on the front, and 2 layer 2 images printed on the back. The sheet could then be cut in half and distributed. If you're printing single sided, it may make more sense to leave this value at 1 and just print all of the layers on one page per course builder. 

## Legend Tab
These options apply to all prints. Here, select the individual items you want displayed in the legend. These values reset with every print. 

## Notes
These options apply to Full Page prints only. Enter your Judge's Notes here and they will appear below the legend. 

## Print Layers
This is the special dialogue to print your layers. Select the layers and whether or not you want any "Quick Hides" to be printed. Quick Hides are hides on your map that are placed in the normal Editor Interface, and not in the special Blinds / Hides Manager. 

## Print Blinds
You must have set up blinds in order to use this feature. This prints an overlaid map with your hides present. You can select all or individual blinds.
