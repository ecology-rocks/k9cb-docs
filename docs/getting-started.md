# Getting Started

The **Dashboard** is your command center. From here, you can create new maps, organize your trials into folders, and manage your account settings.

## Creating a Map

To start a new project, look for the **Create New Map** section at the top of the main area.
1.  Click the **New Barn Hunt Map** card.
2.  The application will automatically generate a blank canvas (defaults to a 24x24 ring) and take you to the **Editor**.

## Organizing Your Work

K9 Course Builder uses a folder-based system to keep your maps organized—perfect for separating different trials or fun matches.

### Using Folders
* **Create Folder:** Click the `+` icon next to the "Folders" header in the sidebar. You can create root folders or subfolders inside your currently selected folder.
* **Rename:** Click the pencil icon (✎) next to any folder name.
* **Delete:** Click the `x` icon next to a folder. *Note: Be careful, this deletes the folder structure.*

### Moving Maps
You can organize your maps using drag-and-drop:
* **Drag a Map:** Click and hold any map card in the "Your Maps" grid, then drag it into a folder in the sidebar.
* **Drag a Folder:** You can also drag folders into other folders to create a nested hierarchy.

## Managing Maps

Each map card displays the map name, the level (e.g., Master, Senior), and the last updated date.

* **Edit:** Opens the map in the Editor.
* **Copy:** Creates a duplicate of the map (appended with "Copy of...") in the same folder. This is useful for creating "Course B" based on "Course A" without starting from scratch.
* **Delete:** Permanently removes the map.
