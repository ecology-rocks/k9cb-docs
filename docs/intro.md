# Introduction

Welcome to the **K9 Course Builder** documentation. This tool was built to help judges and course designers stop fighting with Excel and start designing legal, efficient Barn Hunt courses.

## Why K9 Course Builder?

Designing courses requires balancing creativity with strict rules. K9 Course Builder handles the rules so you can focus on the flow.

### Key Features

* **Smart Scaling:** Change ring sizes instantly. If you need to switch from a 20x20 ring to a 24x24 ring, the tool handles the adjustment without forcing you to redraw every bale.
* **Nesting Support:** Design your whole day in one sitting. You can duplicate maps to ensure courses nest properly, saving volunteer labor during course changes.
* **Legal Printouts:** Generate maps that include:
    * Grid labels
    * Measurements 
    * Automatic Legends
    * Anchor bales
    * Specialized prints for course builders, blind/hide management, and more.
