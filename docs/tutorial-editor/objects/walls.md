# Walls & Zones


## Custom Ring Tool
You have two ways to create a ring. If your ring is a square or rectangle, you can just use the default course settings box to set those four sides of the editor to fence (regular thickness line) or wall (thick line). 

If you have an unusually shaped ring, use the Ring Shape tool. Select it from the sidebar and then click each corner of your expected ring shape to place points. When you're done, click on the first point to complete the loop.

If you're using a custom ring, set your grid size 2 feet wider than the ring on each dimension. This will allow the tool to showcase your ring without viewers getting confused by the grid edges. Don't set your grid edges to wall/fence if you're using a custom ring either.

## Placing Gates
Our gates are designed to stick to either the grid edge (if your ring is a square/rectangle) or to the edges of an already placed custom ring. To place a gate, select the Gate tool and click **close to** the line you want to place it on. If you click directly on the line, your computer may select the line instead of placing the gate. If you've misplaced the gate, you can click it to select it, then drag it to the closest correct location.

## Zones
We offer two colored zone types that function identically in the app. "Dead Zones" are red, and meant to be placed inside the ring in lower level courses to block off unused space. "Obstructions" are grey and meant to indicate that there is some sort of obstruction, like a pole, inside the course. You can customize these by right clicking on them and selecting "Customize" - this will allow you to set the label text and adjust the color. To adjust the size of a zone, click on it once and then drag the corner handles to their new locations.
