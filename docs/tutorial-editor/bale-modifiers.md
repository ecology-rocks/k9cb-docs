# Bale Modifiers

To mark [bales](objects.md#bales) with special characteristics, you'll need to use the bale modifier tools located in the left sidebar. These bale modifier tools can change the orientation, the lean, anchor markings, and anchor lines. Some modifications cannot be used together, e.g., you can't lean anything other than a flat bale, and you can't mark a leaner or a pillar bale as an anchor. Below, find walkthroughs for each of the Bale Modifiers. 

## Anchor Bales

From the Judge Rulebook: 

:::info BHA Rules
**Anchor Bales.** Anchor bales are required for all tunnel structures not against a wall, fence, or other permanent
structure. This anchor bale is noted on the map diagram for the bottom layer and shows a specific measurement to
the corner of the bale to the two nearest sides of the ring so that course builders can accurately place the stack(s).

## Changing Bale Orientation

Bales have three surfaces that they can be laid on: flat, tall, and pillar. Most bales will be flat, but tall bales are often used for tunnels to give more height. Pillar bales are occasionally used but rats cannot be hidden on top of pillar bales. 

:::info BHA Rules on Pillar Bales
**Pillar bales** are stood on end to protrude above the level where they are set. They must be propped on all sides using a
wall and/or bracing bales. They may not be placed against a fence. No tubes may be hidden on top of a pillar bale, and
they do not count toward any specific level height.
